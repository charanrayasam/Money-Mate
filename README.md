# ðŸ’° MoneyMate
MoneyMate is a simple banking app made for fun! It lets you log in, transfer money, request loans, and even close your account (don't worry, it's all just for practice). This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a way to explore DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic financial calculations.

## ðŸš€ Features
### Fake Login System:
  Enter a username and PIN to "log in" (preset accounts only).
### View Transactions:
  See a list of fake deposits and withdrawals.
### Transfer Money:
  Send "money" to another user (itâ€™s all virtual, donâ€™t get too excited).
### Request a Loan:
  Ask for a loan and instantly receive it if you qualify (if only real banks were this easy).
### Close Account:
  Remove your account from the system (again, not real).
### Auto Logout Timer:
  Stay logged in for a while, then get automatically logged out due to "security reasons."
## ðŸŽ® How to Use
Log in using a preset username and PIN.
Check your balance and see recent transactions.
Transfer money to another preset user.
Request a loan (no credit check needed, lucky you).
Close your account if youâ€™re done playing around.
Wait too long? Youâ€™ll be logged out automatically!
